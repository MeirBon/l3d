# Loader-3d
A simple 3d loader written in Rust.
This project does not attempt to become the fastest loading 3D library, it serves as a simple library to quickly get started with the interesting (fun) stuff.
Currently, the project only supports Obj files but it will support glTF soon and adding more formats should be easy.
