# Loader-3d
A simple 3d loader written in Rust.
This project does not attempt to become the fastest loading 3D library, it serves as a simple library to quickly get started with the interesting (fun) stuff.
Currently, the project only supports Obj and glTF files but adding more formats should be easy.
